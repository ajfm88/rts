// Merging (reopening) an interface in TypeScript is a process where you declare an
// interface with the same name more than once, and TypeScript will merge their members.

// Merging the interface
interface Person {
  age: number;
}

// Usage
const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  getDetails() {
    return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`;
  },
};

// Extending an interface in TypeScript is a way to create a new interface that inherits
// the properties and methods of an existing interface. You use the extends keyword to
// do this. When you extend an interface, the new interface will have all the members
// of the base interface, plus any new members that you add.

// Extending the interface
interface Employee extends Person {
  employeeId: number;
}

const employee2: Employee = {
  name: "jane",
  age: 28,
  employeeId: 123,
  getDetails() {
    return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}, Employee ID: ${this.employeeId}`;
  },

// Interface multiple inheritance

  managePeople(): void;

/*
## Challenge - Part 1
*/

//Define the Person interface: Start by defining a Person interface with a name property of type string.
interface Person {
  name: string;
}

//Define the DogOwner interface: Next, define a DogOwner interface that extends Person and adds a
//dogName property of type string.
interface DogOwner extends Person {
  dogName: string;
}

//Define the Manager interface: Then, define a Manager interface that extends Person and adds two methods:
// managePeople and delegateTasks. Both methods should have a return type of void.
interface Manager extends Person {
  managePeople(): void;
  delegateTasks(): void;
}

//Define the getEmployee function: Now, define a function called getEmployee that returns a Person, DogOwner, or Manager.
// Inside this function, generate a random number and use it to decide which type of object to return.
// If the number is less than 0.33, return a Person. If it's less than 0.66, return a DogOwner.
// Otherwise, return a Manager.
function getEmployee(): Person | DogOwner | Manager {
  const random = Math.random();

  if (random < 0.33) {
    return {
      name: "mark",
    };
  } else if (random < 0.66) {
    return {
      name: "sarah",
      dogName: "Rex",
    };
  } else {
    return {
      name: "bob",
      managePeople: () => console.log("Managing people..."),
      delegateTasks: () => console.log("Delegating tasks..."),
    };
  }
}

//Finally, create a variable called employee that can be a Person, DogOwner, or Manager, and assign it the return value of getEmployee.
// Then, log employee to the console.
const employee: Person | DogOwner | Manager = getEmployee();
console.log(employee);

/*
## Challenge - Part 2

A type predicate in TypeScript is a special kind of return type for a function that not only returns a boolean, 
but also asserts that the argument is of a specific type if the function returns true. It's typically used in 
user-defined type guard functions to narrow down the type of a variable within a certain scope. 
The syntax is arg is Type, where arg is the function argument and Type is the type you're checking for.
*/

// function isManager(obj: Person | DogOwner | Manager): boolean {
//   return 'managePeople' in obj;
// }

// - Define the isManager function: Define a function called isManager that takes an object of type Person | DogOwner | Manager
// and returns a boolean. This function should check if the managePeople method exists on the object, and return true if it does
// and false if it doesn't. The return type of this function should be a type predicate: obj is Manager.
function isManager(obj: Person | DogOwner | Manager): obj is Manager {
  return "managePeople" in obj;
}
//- Run your code to see if it works as expected. If employee is a Manager, you should see the output
// of the delegateTasks method in the console. If employee is a Person or DogOwner, there should be no output.
if (isManager(employee)) {
  employee.delegateTasks();
}

/*
## Interface vs Type Alias

A type alias is a way to give a name to a type. It can represent primitive types, union types, intersection types, tuples, 
and any other types. Once defined, the alias can be used anywhere in place of the actual type.
*/

type Person2 = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

let jack: Person2 = { name: "Jack", age: 30 };

// Interface

// An interface is a way to define a contract for a certain structure of an object.

interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

let jill: Person = { name: "Jill", age: 30 };

// Key Differences

// - Type aliases can represent primitive types, union types, intersection types, tuples, etc.,
// while interfaces are primarily used to represent the shape of an object.

// Type alias for a primitive type
type Score = number;
type NumberOrString = number | string;
// Type alias for literal types
type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right";

// Using the type aliases
let gameScore: Score = 100;
let move: Direction = "up";

// - Interfaces can be merged using declaration merging. If you define an interface with the same name more than once,
// TypeScript will merge their definitions. Type aliases can't be merged in this way.

// - Interfaces can be implemented by classes, while type aliases cannot.
// - Type aliases can use computed properties, while interfaces cannot.

  name: string;
  greet(): void;

  name: string;

  constructor(name: string) {

  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);

let john = new Employee("John");
john.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is John
